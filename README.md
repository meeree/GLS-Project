# GLS-Projec
Welcome to the GLS (Generalized Lindenmeyer System) project. 
I was inspired to create this project after looking at the other L-Systems -- and parsers for such languages -- currently available. 
Though these languages are quite powerful for simulating growth graphically, this is all they can be used for. 
My hope in this project is to embrace the full potential of the L-System model by adding my own features such as nested probability and conditions. 
Eventually, I hope to add context-sensitivity to the language as it would then be usable as a full on language (as it is turing complete). 
My code includes a hand-written parser and L-system model.
